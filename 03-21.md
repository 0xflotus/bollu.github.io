# DD/MM

## Carry over from previous day

* trying to undestand how to generate code correctly without using `addPrivatizationDependences`.
* lots of tests fail. Some because `#pramga` is not generated, some because generated `RAW/WAW/WAR/Reduction` dependences are different.

```

* Notice that `-1 + i1` actually goes out of the domain. apparently, this does not matter since we tend to intersect with the actual domain when we use it (eg. dead code elimination). However, this is something to keep in mind, as this could be intefering with things.


### understanding `buildFlow`

- for some reason, changing the `may-source` of the flow seems to affect the `must-dependence` information generated. [Asked question on ISL mailing list: link here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/isl-development/oyBi_wTUHKA).

### generate more `WAW` dependences

- use `buildFlow` with a combination of all writes (May + Must). Before only must-writes were used. This gives more information

- remove use of `Read` for the `may_src` parameter in buildFlow. It is strange that this is there in the codebase. It maybe an optimisation __if `may_src` does not interfere with `must_src`__. However, it looks like there is interference, so the optimisation does not make sense.

### Semantics of buildFlow
- [isl mailing list link: click](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/isl-development/oyBi_wTUHKA)
- turns out that `may_src` does interfere with `must_src`. 
- a must dependence is only one of the form `sink <- ... <no may src> ... <- must_src`
- may dependences are of the form `sink <- ... <- may_src` *as well as* `sink <- ... <- may_src <- .. must_src`. 
- Clearly, this changes the semantics. So, Polly seems to use `buildFlow` incorrectly.

##### Polly usage of `buildFlow`:


```cpp
//prototype
static __isl_give isl_union_flow *buildFlow(__isl_keep isl_union_map *Snk,
                                            __isl_keep isl_union_map *Src,
                                            __isl_keep isl_union_map *MaySrc,
                                            __isl_keep isl_schedule *Schedule);
 

void Dependences::calculateDependences(Scop &S) {
	...
	Flow = buildFlow(MustWrite, MustWrite, Read, Schedule);

	WAW = isl_union_flow_get_must_dependence(Flow);
	WAR = isl_union_flow_get_may_dependence(Flow);
	...
}
```

- more things are tracked as `WAR` dependences than correct. For example, something of the form
`write <- read <- write` is tracked as a `WAR` and not as a `WAW`.
- Similarly, less `WAW` dependences are tracked than correct. 
- Correcting this is hard, since almost every test case will end up breaking as they use the `WAW` and `WAR` dependence info printed out.

### Current plan of action to remove `addPrivitaizationDependences`:

- keep the (incorrect) `WAW` and `WAR` the same
- add a new map called `False` to track the `WAW` + `WAR` dependences. 
- These are called "false" dependences since there is no actual dependence in terms of data flow for `WAW+WAR`. Only `RAW` requires data flow.
- use `False` to remove use of `TC_RED`, so that we don't need to compute transitive closure.


### Doubt: `TC_RED` computes *reverse* of the transitive closure as well for some reason

###### Example:
```cpp
static const int N = 3000;

void f(int A[N], int *sum) {
  for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    *sum += A[i];
  }
}
```

```cpp
	Transitive closure of reduction dependences:
		{ Stmt_for_body[i0] -> Stmt_for_body[o0] : (i0 >= 0 and i0 < o0 <= 2999) or (i0 <= 2999 and 0 <= o0 < i0) }
```
- reverse is here: `(i0 <= 2999 and 0 <= o0 < i0)`
- See no need for this currently. Perhaps use will crop up in the future.
- for now, not emulating behaviour
