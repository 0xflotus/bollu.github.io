# 03/24

## Carry over from yesterday
- Getting all test cases to pass with new WAW & WAR dependence

## Work today
- undersatnd why `WAR = WAR - WAW`.
- Asked tobias. Was apparently change made to use new style of code, but still maintain compatibility with old behaviour (make sure it is `[NFC]`).
- Agrees it needs to be removed.
- Many test cases fail, however. Need to fix this

### Fixing Reduction codegen
- Reduction codegen worked as a side-effect of the way `WAW` dependences were being generated.
- Before, `WAW` only contained `W (sink) <- W (source)`. Things of the form `W(sink) <- .. R <- .. W (source)` were not considered as `WAW`.
- This is an incorrect notion of `WAW`. **However**, when it comes to reductions, we need only these kinds of `WAW`!

```cpp
example-of-strict-WAW.cpp

int reader[100];
int sum = 0;

for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
S0: 	sum += i;
	
	if (i >= 500 && i <= 600) {
S1:		reader[i - 500] = sum;
	}
}
```

- we have `WAW` between successive S0. 
- **but** between `500 <= i <= 600`, the writes in `S0` thread through the reads in `S1`.
- These are *not* reductions since we cannot freely rearrange them! the values written into `reader` will be different based on our reordering!
- So, when we compute `WAW` **for reuductions**, we need only strict WAW dependences.


### Behaviout I do not understand: `DependenceInfo/different_schedule_dimensions.ll`
```cpp
DependenceInfo/different_schedule_dimensions.ll

define void @hoge(i32 %arg, [1024 x double]* %arg1) {
bb:
  br label %bb2

bb2:                                              ; preds = %bb
  br label %bb3

bb3:                                              ; preds = %bb10, %bb2
  %tmp = phi i64 [ 0, %bb10 ], [ 0, %bb2 ]
  %tmp4 = icmp sgt i32 %arg, 0
  %tmp5 = getelementptr inbounds [1024 x double], [1024 x double]* %arg1, i64 0, i64 0
  > %tmp6 = load double, double* %tmp5, align 8
  %tmp7 = fadd double 2.3, %tmp6
  > store double %tmp7, double* %tmp5, align 8
  br i1 false, label %bb8, label %bb9

bb8:                                              ; preds = %bb3
  br label %bb10

bb9:                                              ; preds = %bb3
  br label %bb10

bb10:                                             ; preds = %bb9, %bb8
  %tmp11 = phi double [ undef, %bb8 ], [ undef, %bb9 ]
  %tmp12 = getelementptr inbounds [1024 x double], [1024 x double]* %arg1, i64 %tmp, i64 0
  > store double %tmp11, double* %tmp12, align 8
  %tmp13 = add nuw nsw i64 0, 1
  %tmp14 = trunc i64 %tmp13 to i32
  br i1 false, label %bb3, label %bb15

bb15:                                             ; preds = %bb10
  br label %bb16

bb16:                                             ; preds = %bb15
  ret void
}
```

##### Generated dependences:
```cpp
	RAW dependences:
		{ Stmt_bb9[0] -> Stmt_bb10[0] }
	WAR dependences:
		{ Stmt_bb3[0] -> Stmt_bb10[0] }
	WAW dependences:
		{ Stmt_bb3[0] -> Stmt_bb10[0] }
	Reduction dependences:
		{  }
	Transitive closure of reduction dependences:
		{  }
```
- `RAW bb9 -> bb10` makes no sense! there's no write at `bb9`.
- `WAR bb3 -> bb10` makes sense.
- Why is there *no* `WAR bb3[0] -> bb3[0]`? `bb3` has both a `load` and a `store` into `%arg1` with `%tmp5`
- Are these not tracked? splitting the `store` into a separate basic block `bbaux` causes these to be recorded. Strange.
