The idea is for the website to contain blog posts, along with visualizations of
math / graphics / programming.

The former has been semi-forced thanks to GSoC, as for the latter, it remains
to be seen. I'm hopeful, though :)

# Reading
- [2018 reading](content/blog/stuff-i-learnt-this-year-2018.md)
- [2017 reading](content/blog/papers-I-read-and-loved-in-2017.md)

# Haskell
- [Reading the `structs` library](content/blog/reading-kmett-structs.md)
- [Reading the `machines` library (WIP)](content/blog/machines/reading-kmett-machines.md)
- [Explaining laziness (WIP)](content/blog/laziness-for-c-programmers.md)
- [Explaining STG(WIP)](stg-explained.md)

# Simplexhc (STG -> LLVM compiler) progress
- [proc points suck / making GHC an order of magnitude faster](content/blog/ghc-micro-optimisations-or-why-proc-points-suck.md)
    Note: this renders better on the website. I've put it up here,
    but I need to migrate the images and plots to be static.
