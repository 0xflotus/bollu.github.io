The idea is for the website to contain blog posts, along with visualizations of
math / graphics / programming.

The former has been semi-forced thanks to GSoC, as for the latter, it remains
to be seen. I'm hopeful, though :)

# Ideas I stumble onto
## How does one work with arrays in a linear language?

Given an array of qubits `xs: Qubit[]`, I want to switch to little endian.
Due to no-cloning, I can't copy them! I suppose I can use recursion to build
up a new "list". But this is not the efficient array version we know and love
and want. 

The code that I want to work but does not:
```lang=csharp
function switchEndian(xs: Qubit[]): Unit {
    for(i in 0..Length(xs) - 1) {
        Qubit q = xs[i]; // boom, this does not work!
        xs[i] = xs[Length(xs) - 1 - i]
        xs[Length(xs) - 1 - i] = q;
    }
}
```

On the other hand, what _does work_ is to setup a quantum circuit that
performs this flipping, since it's a permutation matrix at the end of
the day. But this is very slow, since it needs to simulate the "quantumness"
of the solution, since it takes `2^n` basis vectors for `n` qubits. 

However, the usual recursion based solution works:
```lang=csharp
function switchEndian(xs: Qubit[]): Qubit[] {
    if(Length(xs) == 1) {
        return xs;
    } else {
        switchEndian(xs[1..(Length(xs) - 1)] + xs[0]
    }
}
```

This is of course, suboptimal.

I find it interesting that in the linear types world, often the "pure" solution
is _forced_ since mutation very often involves temporaries / copying!

(I'm solving assignments in [qsharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/)
for my course in college)

## How Linear optimisation is the same as Linear feasibility checking
Core building blog of effecively using the ellipsoid algorithm.

- If we posess a way to check if a point `p âˆˆ P` where `P` is a polytope, we
  can use this to solve optimisation problems.
- Given the optimisation problem maximise `c^Tx` subject to `Ax = b`, we can
  construct a new _non-emptiness_ problem. This allows us to convert optimisation
  into _feasibility_.
- The new problem is `Ax = b, A^Ty = c, c^Tx = b^T y`. Note that by duality,
  a point in this new polyhedra will _be an optimal solution to the above linear program_.
  We are forcing `c^Tx = b^Ty`, which will be the optimal solution, since the
  solution where the primal and dual agree is the optimal solution by strong
  duality.
- This way, we have converted a _linear programming_ problem into a 
  _check if this polytope is empty_ problem!

## Quantum computation without complex numbers
I recently learnt that the Toeffili and Hadamard gates are universal for
quantum computation. The description of these gates involve no complex numbers.
So, we can write any quantum circuit in a "complex number free" form. The caveat
is that we may very well have _input qubits_ that require complex numbers.

Even so, a large number (all?) of the basic algorithms shown in Nielsen and
Chaung can be encoded in an entirely complex-number free fashion.

I don't really understand the ramifications of this, since I had the intuition
that the power of quantum computation comes from the ability to express
complex phases along with superposition (tensoring). However, I now have
to remove the power from going from R to C in many cases. This is definitely
something to ponder.


## Linguistic fun fact: Comparative Illusion

I steal from wikipedia:

> Comparative Illusion, which is a grammatical illusion where certain

> reflection actually make no sense. 

For example: "More people have been to Berlin than I have."
