      <description>First thing&amp;rsquo;s first - I moved this from bollu.github.io to pixel-druid.com. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this domain for around a year now, but I never got around to do anything with it. The excuse that I was using was that &amp;ldquo;there is no space on my EC2 instance&amp;rdquo;, which makes no real sense when you think about it, since it was a fresh off-the-shelf Ubuntu install. It turns out that nginx wrote out an error log file into /etc/nginx/error.</description>
