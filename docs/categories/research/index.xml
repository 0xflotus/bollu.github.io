      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with group theory and graph theory for a while now, so I thought that it was high-time to install [SAGE](), a Python based environment for math computation.
Unfortunately, the documentation for SAGE is very fragmented, so the experience of getting it up and running wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly enjoyable. However, once you do get it up and running, it&amp;rsquo;s really slick to use.
It&amp;rsquo;s for this reason that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that this will be a living document consisting of all SAGE usage and information that I find out.</description>
