      <description>Indian semantics viewpoint on RNNs  An indian semantics view of why RNNs work. Consider the way in which we speak. We produce a sequence of ephemeral sounds, which are then cognized. That is, cognition is a two step process: seq of sounds -&amp;gt; word meaning.
 Assume this is not the case, and we have an intermediate stage of processing, where we cognize the word in its lexical/ syntactic entireity, without reaching the semantic level, and only from this lexical entity to we then construct the semantics.</description>
