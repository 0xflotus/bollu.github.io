## Carry over from yesterday
- get `pattern_matching_opts` working

## Work today

#### Pattern matching on matrix multiplication
- Before, matrix multiplication used to have reduction dependences of the form:
```
S[i_0, i_1, ... i_k,  .. i_n] -> S[i_0, i_1, ... , i_k + 1, ..., i_n)
```
- Now, we generate:
```
S[i_0, i_1, ... i_k,  .. i_n] -> S[i_0, i_1, ... , 0 <= o_k <= N, ..., i_n)
```

- We need to change the way pattern matching happens so that this case is handled.

- Since most of the surrounding code checks that the memory accesses "look right", we can (hopefully) get away with simply checking that in the `deltas` of the map, all except one dimension is `0`._
