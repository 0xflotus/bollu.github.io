Algorithm vs data structure
A proof technique is like an algorith, while an algebraic object is like
a data structure. The existence of an algebraic object allows us to
"meditate" on the proof technique as a separate object that does not
move through time. Meditating on a proof technique is much harder, as is
seeing if a proof techique can be applied in different places. 
"Music is art in time. Art is music in space".

On the other hand, this is probably pointless in combinatorics, because
each proof is a technique unto itself. Or, perhaps instantiating the
technique for each proof is difficult enough that abstracting it out
is not useful enough in the first place. A good example of a proof
technique that got studied on its own right is the probabilistic method. A
more reasonable example is that of the Pigeonhole principle, which still
requires insight to instantiate in practise.

Not that this does not occur in algebra either, but there is something in
algebra about how just meditating on the definitions. For example,
Whitney trick that got pulled out of the proof of the Whitney embedding
theorem.

It's the same joy of being able to write down the type of a haskell function
and know exactly what it does, enough that a program can automatically
derive the function (djinn). The fact that we know the object well enough
that just writing the type down allows us to infer the _program_!.
