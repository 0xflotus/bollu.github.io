Here's a handy guideline for people who are comfortable with Coq, but not
with SSReflect. As someone who belonged to this category, I struggled to find
resources that did not bore me (since I already knew Coq), but did not overwhelm
me (since I didn't know SSReflect). I'd like this blog post to be a stable
reference as quick cheat-sheet for someone who's transitioning from using
Coq to using Coq+SSReflect.
