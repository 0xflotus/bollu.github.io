# Indian semantics viewpoint on RNNs

- An indian semantics view of why RNNs work. Consider the way in which we
  speak. We produce a sequence of ephemeral sounds, which are then cognized.
  That is, cognition is a two step process: `seq of sounds -> word meaning`.

- Assume this is not the case, and we have an intermediate stage of processing,
  where we cognize the word in its lexical/ syntactic entireity, without
  reaching the semantic level, and only from this lexical entity to we then
  construct the semantics. That is, cognition is now a three step process: `seq
  of sounds -> lexical words -> word meaning`.
  However, in this case, we still need to _identify when we construct lexical
  words_. Hence, we have simply punted the problem of "discovering word meaning"
  to "discovering words". 

- Therefore, we can argue that we should be able to construct meaning directly
from the sequence. Really slick argument


# Indian semantics take on sound and color
This is absolute BS, but was very entertaining to learn about. Supposedly,
the ancients in India thought that sound was the primary sense. Color arose
by compressing sound till it "hangs in space". Which is why the words
`raag`(sound) and `rang`(color) sound so similar!

Reminds me of another quote: "Art decorates space, music decorates time".

Reminds me of Fourier transforms.
