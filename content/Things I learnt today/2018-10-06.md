problems - [example](file:///home/bollu/Downloads/notebook.pdf)

- Edward Kmett's `structs` library, trying to implement an imperative
world within GHC - [link](https://github.com/ekmett/structs)

# Reading

- I was asked to check out "Whose Justice? Which Rationality?" by
    Alasdair MacIntyre

- "The book of why" by the person who came up with do-calculus.
