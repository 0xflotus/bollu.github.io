## Carry over from yesterday
- rebase reduction branch onto the `only-edit-build-flow` branch
- write small script to check that AST generated is the same between master and privatization branch
- send changes to phab

## Work today
- perhaps improve reduction detection
- Or, alternatively, start work on the weather modelling codebase
