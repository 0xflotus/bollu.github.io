## Carry over from yesterday
- Finish patch to start using `False` dependences

## Work today
### Abandoning patch to use `False` throughout codebase
- computing reductions makes explicit use of `WAW` without looking at `WAR`.
- `False` is not possible.
- Should have noticed this before `:/`, my fault. 

### Track may-writes when building `WAW` and `WAR`
- changes being explored on `bollu/polly/only-edit-build-flow`
- found change that causes test case to hang:
```cpp
```
- `WAR = WAR - WAW`. **Need to understand this**
- Now going through each failing test case one by one to understand why they fail.
- Interesting, reductions test case seems to engineered to fail if we do what I do. Particularly `DependenceInfo/reduction_partially_escaping_intermediate_in_other_stmt.ll`
