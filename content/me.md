I'm an Undergrad computer science student at IIIT-Hyderabad. I enjoy various
branches of pure mathematics which have an algebraic or geometric flavour,
programming, and cooking. 

As a single source of truth, please check [my github page](https://www.github.com/bollu) to learn more
about what I'm currently working on now, since this page will most definitely 
bit rot.


However, for a flavour of what I have liked in the past, it has been
(in no real order):

- Functional programming, particularly purely functional languages like haskell.
- Formal verification, dependent type theory, Coq, and things in the general
  space of "I proved this _for sure_."
- Compiling such languages so that they're fast.
- Polyhedral compilation, and the math surrounding it (Particularly the
  Barvinok algorithm).
- Information theory, Cryptography, and Quantum computation.
- Currently (as of 2019), bayesian inference and explainable machine learning
models.
- FPGAs. I wish to play more with them, but I've messed around a little and got
  burnt by the sheer pain of Xilinx tools.
