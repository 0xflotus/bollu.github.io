# 03/31

## Carry over from yesterday
- Came back from LLVM Conf
- Get [polly patch for correctness of data dependences upstreamed](https://reviews.llvm.org/D31386)
- Investigate reductions using may-writes
- Building JIT for Haskell Free monads

## Work today

#### Discussion about Paralleising Haskell
- What should the output of our data dependences look like?
- Considered using Zippers to represent what dependences look like
- Need to "parametrize" zippers
- Can represent this recursively? Will have to see
- Apparently, a related problem is generating FFT code according to Tobias.
- Started reading surrounding literature

### Getting Reductions to work with may-writes
- Working on branch [remove-privatization-with-may-reduction](https://github.com/bollu/polly/tree/remove-privatization-with-may-reduction)
